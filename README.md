# Super-Mario-JS

The goal of this project is to basically introduce participants to the
basic structure of how a game works internally. What kind of logics are required to create the games we played since childhood. We will be using JavaScript and HTML Canvas to create a 2D Super Mario game, so that we can freely play the game in our browsers.

### Note- A cheatSheet for HTML Canvas has been provided with boilerplate

## Project Structure

- There is one html file for structuring our game as a website
- There are two folders
  - Assets- Contains all the spritesheets, icons etc.
  - Entities- Files containing the game logics for various entities of our game
- Then there are several JS files which are self explanatory and does their respective work

## What you have to do?

- Fork the boilerplate code into your system and create a folder of your own name through which you registered in the divs programme.
- Add all the boilerplate code and assets in that folder too and make changes as we progress through the project
- After every task, make a pull request.

## Your tasks

- There is a coordinates.js file in the assets/Map folder which contains the coordinates for our background objects and entities, make changes to the coordinates and create your own custom level in the game.
- Change the input options of the game, instead of using arrow keys, try incooperating other keys such as S,W,A,D to move around.
- Alter the Physics file with your custom speed of Mario and other entities, also you can change the gravity aspects.
- You will be taught how to code for few of the entities of the Entity folder, rest will be done by you.
